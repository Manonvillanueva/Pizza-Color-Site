            The story of pizza is a long one. From the Greeks to the Egyptians,
            from the Persians to the Indians, there have been incarnations of
            pizza served throughout history. Flatbreads, naan, and plakountos
            are all early preparations that could be considered cousins to the
            modern pizza, but there isn’t a consensus as to which is first and
            whether these could even be considered precursors to pizza at all.
